@article{wickham2007_ReshapingDatareshape,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the reshape package for R, which provides a common framework for many types of data reshaping and aggregation. It uses a paradigm of `melting' and `casting', where the data are `melted' into a form which distinguishes measured and identifying variables, and then `cast' into a new shape, whether it be a data frame, list, or high dimensional array. The paper includes an introduction to the conceptual framework, practical advice for melting and casting, and a case study.},

More complex models are possible. Frailties can be nested; individuals within a fanulty may share a common frailty, while families withm communities share another common frailty. Frailties can also be correlated, as in studies of pedigrees. Due to its simphcity, we emphasize the shared frailty model here.},
